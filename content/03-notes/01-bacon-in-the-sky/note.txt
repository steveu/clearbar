Hot damn! I&#039;ve only gone and launched a personal website. Seriously, making websites for other people is far easier than doing so for yourself.

I've worked on the current incarnation for a year or so (<em>and by working I mean endlesly moving things around by 1 pixel</em>), but it&#039;s been about 5 since I had a website, and I must have started different designs 10 times over.
