Title: Bacon In The Sky ... With Diamonds.

Hot damn I&apos;ve only launched a personal website! As something of a serial scrapper, I&apos;ve burnt through my fair share of designs, all preferable to the fat nothing my domain has sported for the last 5 years.

Recently I&apos;ve begun to consider why I even want a website, and I believe this has tipped me over the edge. Thus as an eternal reminder of the solution to scrapping, I shall now <em>scratch my reasons into this HTML</em>.

## Learn by doing

I want to experiment with the bleeding edge techniques which make my profession fantastic. I shall also improve something more important, my writing, which whilst not a disaster, needs the polish which only consistently doing can bring.

## Make waves

Nope, not (link: https://wave.google.com/wave/?pli=1 text: that kind). The Web is constantly shifting. I will use Clearbar to document the work I am proud of, before it's inevitable demise.

## Give something back

I&apos;ve been making websites professionally for 8 years, during which time I've consumed vast quantities of content, created by supremely talented people. Yet I never contribute, I don't even leave comments.

This will change. Hold me to it.
