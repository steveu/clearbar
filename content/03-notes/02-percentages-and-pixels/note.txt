When building a _properly_ responsive layout, gutters set in % become inappropriately sized at both large and small window sizes. _Using some simple and pretty well supported CSS (IE8+) we can damn well fix that_.

Conceptually, the obvious CSS for a liquid layout is something like this;
	
	.sidebar {
		width: 20%;
		padding-left: 10%;
		float: left;
	}
	.content {
		width: 60%;
		padding-left: 10%;
		float: left;
	}
	
The problem being; at iPad size the gap between columns is too small, and on your shiny new cinema display, it's gonna be too damn big!

## Are we just gonna take this?

_(Hell no)_

So, what missunderstood HTML element could have pixel (or em) padding, as well as a percentage width. Did I hear you say `<table>`? Give yourself a gold plated iPhone.

	.sidebar, .content {
		display: table;
		padding-left: 24px;
		float: left;
	}
	.sidebar {
		width: 30%;
	}
	.content {
		width: 70%;
	}

_This_ is gonna to give us a liquid layout, with fixed pixel gutters.

There is an alternative; `box-sizing: border-box` which switches the box model akin to IE6 in quirks mode, where padding and borders are not counted in the width of an element.

	-moz-box-sizing: border-box;
	-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
	-ms-box-sizing: border-box;
	box-sizing: border-box;

Judging by all those vendor prefixes, it should be obvious that `box-sizing` ((link: http://www.browsersupport.net/CSS/box-sizing text: support stats)) has inferior browser support than `display: table` ((link: http://www.browsersupport.net/CSS/display%3Atable text: support stats)).

That said, if the mention of tables send shivers down your spine, it might be better for your soul.

It will however also avoid inconsistencies

## Can we do better than pixels?

We could use alternative pixel padding values within a series of media queries, so we could make use of the space afforded by larger screens with appropriate padding.

My personal preference however is to set gutters in ems, and control the gutter widths using the base font size.

	body {
		font-size: 16px;
	}
	@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
		body {
			font-size: 18px;
		}
	}
	/* and onwards */

	.sidebar, .content {
		display: table;
		padding-left: 2em; /* either 32px, or 36px */
		float: left;
	}

Boom. Go forth and build.
