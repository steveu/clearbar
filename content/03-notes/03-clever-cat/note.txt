Our brains are hardwired to attribute human characteristics to many things we know to lack them. From pets (they really aren't clever), to abstract things like countries, and even simple things like plug sockets, to the UI of digital products. 

Despite being able to rationally detach these human characteristics, we can't help but see them anyway. We see human behaviour and features everywhere we look.

## Putting it to work for us

This phenomenon (anthropomorphism for those who like to sound clever) can be put to use by designers, giving inanimate objects personality and guiding a positive user experience around digital products and services, which we not only come to see as allies, but in many cases *as friends*.

Can you really imagine treating this little dude as you might treat your desktop printer (which im my case is a toxic combination of disdain and rage), or throwing a cup this cute in a non recycling bin?

Nope though not. These designs can strongly infulence our reactions and behavious to the objects around us.

## So, should I draw a face on my next website?

*Yes this is a rhetorical question*. Clearly there are levels, and no verything needs a face.

I actually been making use of this in my own work, most recently on (link: http://cliffdesign.co.uk/ text: Cliff Design), where the open/close functionality uses subtle animation, turning a 50 pixel green square into a little character who fetches content at your call (well hopefully).

I did experiment with a little face instead of the text and arrow combination, but I found it was actually unecessary as the character all came from the movement, as well as making the functionality less ovbious.

On the same site, I added a few nods to a digital assistant in the contact form.

Wish Siri worked properly.
