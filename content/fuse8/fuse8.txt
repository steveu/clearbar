Title: Hello fuse8

# I&#8217;m Steve Urmston! I deliver smart interfaces for websites and apps.

## What&#8217;s my story?

I&#8217;ve been _giddy_ with excitement creating virtual things since I first had a computer&#8212;Polygon drawing on a BBC Micro and CompuServe and AOL webpages&#8212;I was hooked.

Without realising I could make a living doing something that fun, I did a Politics degree. On realising my mistake, I started a web design business. Eight years and a more relevant degree later; I'm still giddy at my fortune to be doing what I love.

## Why fuse8?

In a word, <em>quality</em>. Your commitment to which is obvious from even a brief glance though your past work (_I&#8217;ve had more than a glance!_). I want to be involved in creating quality work that improves the world, even if that's in a modest way.

I&#8217;ll be honest, your work extends into areas where my knowledge is weak; Marketing, PR, Advertising and the like, and in the past this would have scared me away. I've come to realise that I'm effective away from my comfort zone, and I&#8217;m looking at that wide-ranging remit both as a challenge and an opportunity to grow.

## Top 10 reasons

1. Passion
2. I&#8217;m smart and creative.
2. I design and code, but do my best work in between.
3. I&#8217;m empathetic and a good communicator, without being loud.
4. I can think on my feet, and under pressure.
5. I&#8217;m good in meetings.
6. I understand requirements and translate them to interactive products.
7. I&#8217;m modest and humble, but realise this isn't the time for modesty.
