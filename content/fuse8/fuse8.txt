# I&#8217;m Steve Urmston! I deliver smart interfaces for websites and apps.

And I think I&#8217;m perfect for your [Middleweight IA/UX Designer role](http://www.fuse8.com/work+at+fuse+8/career-details/middleweight-ia/ux-designer-19681).

## What&#8217;s my story?

I&#8217;ve been _giddy_ with excitement creating virtual things since I first had a computer&#8212;Polygon drawing on a BBC Micro to CompuServe webpages&#8212;I was hooked.

Without realising I could make a living doing something that fun, I did a Politics degree. On realising my mistake, I started a web design business. Eight years and a [more relevant degree later](/cv); I'm still giddy at my fortune to be doing what I love.

## Why fuse8?

In a word, <em>quality</em>, your commitment to which is obvious from even a brief glance at your past work (_I&#8217;ve had more than a glance!_). I want to help create things which improve the world, even in a modest way, and I believe I could do that with you.

I&#8217;ll be honest, your work extends into areas where my knowledge is not as strong; Marketing, PR, Advertising and the like, and in the past this would have scared me away.

However I&#8217;ve come to realise these disciplines are all necessary parts of creating great experiences, and I&#8217;m looking at that wide-ranging remit both as a challenge and an opportunity to grow.

## Top 8 _Why Me?_ Reasons

1. Passion
2. I&#8217;m smart and creative.
2. I design and code, but do my best work in between.
3. I&#8217;m empathetic and a good communicator, without being loud.
4. I can think on my feet, and under pressure.
5. I&#8217;m good in meetings.
6. I understand requirements and can turn them to interactive products.
7. I&#8217;m modest and humble, but realise this isn't the time for modesty.

## We should talk

I know the job post asks for workings, which in my case tend to be sketchbook based, and don't show well electronically. If I might point you at [my portfolio](/work), and in particular at my [MSc Dissertation project](/work/#game-mechanics) hopefully this will show my thinking.

I would love the chance to speak with you about the role. Contact me at any of the following;
