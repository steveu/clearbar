I developed a set of PHP5 classes to enable the rapid production of form-based web applications.

_Features include&hellip;_

* Read/Write database scaffolding
* Optional (<em>but sexy</em>) AJAX processing
* Step based session forms
* Sensible defaults + powerful config
* Individual field and global error messages
* Payment gateway integration for checkout forms

There is a impoverished version of these classes on (link: https://github.com/clearbar/Form-Builder text:Github). I'm working on full featured code, but much is heavily integrated with a private codebase.
