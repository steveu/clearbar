# Hiya, I'm Steve.

I&rsquo;m a 32 year old interactive designer and web developer from York, where I live in Acomb with my beautiful <del>fiancé</del> <ins>wife</ins> Sarah.

I love my music, particularly deep house, funk &amp; disco (occasional techno). I sometimes DJ in my living room.

I enjoy sports, both watching and playing. I'm a season ticket holder at the mighty Bolton Wanderers.
