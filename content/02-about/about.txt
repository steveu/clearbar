# Hiya, I'm Steve.

I&rsquo;m a thirty-something, interactive designer and web developer from York, where I live in Acomb with my beautiful <del>fiancé</del> <ins>wife</ins> Sarah.

I love music, particularly deep house, funk and disco (maybe a dash of techno). I occassionally DJ in my (modest) living room.

I enjoy more than my fair share of sports, both watching and playing. I'm a season ticket holder at the mighty Bolton Wanderers.

## What the heck is Clearbar?

It used to be my web design business, but is now my personal website where I keep my portfolio of (link: work text: work), and sporadically post (link: notes text: notes).
