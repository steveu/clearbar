# Hello there, I'm Steve Urmston.

I&rsquo;m a thirty-something, interactive designer and web developer from York, where I live in Acomb with my beautiful <del>fiancé</del> <ins>wife</ins> Sarah.

I've been making websites and applications professionally for 7 years.
		
I&rsquo;ve got two degrees, an entertaining but irrelevant Political Science Masters from Glasgow, and a second altogether more relevant and equally entertaining MSc in (link: http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught-courses/msc-hcit/ text: Human-Centred Interactive Technologies) from York University.

I work at (link: http://designition.co.uk/ text: Designition), where I&rsquo;m involved throughout; from meetings though design, to production code. But my expertise is in interaction design and front-end development, and I'm passionate about delightful interfaces and interactions.
