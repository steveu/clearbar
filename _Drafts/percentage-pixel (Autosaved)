# Percentage Containers With Pixel or Em Based Gutters

_The old problem with liquid layouts was gutters set in percentages become inappropriate sized for both very large and very small window sizes. Using some simple and reasonably well supported CSS we can fix that, and create proper responsive layouts._

Conceptually the most obvious way to build a liquid layout might be along these lines;
	
	.sidebar {
		width: 25%;
		float: left;
	}
	.content {
		width: 60%;
		padding-left: 15%;
		float: right;
	}
	

When developing responsive CSS layouts, I prefer using percentages to divide my page, in effect creating liquid layouts as opposed to the more commonplace method of creating sets of varying sized fixed layouts.
