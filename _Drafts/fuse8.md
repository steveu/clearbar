# Hello fuse8

## I'm Steve Urmston. I create smart interfaces for websites and apps.

### My story

I've been giddy with excitement creating virtual things ever since having access to a computer, from polygon drawing on a BBC Micro, to CompuServe and AOL webpages, I was instantly hooked.

Without realising I could make a living doing something that fun, I did a Politics degree. On realising my mistake, I started a web design business. Eight years on and I'm still giddy at my fortune to be doing what I love.

### Why fuse8

In a word, quality. Your commitment to which is obvious from even a brief glance though your past work (I've had a bit more than a glance!).

I'll be honest, your work extends into areas where my knowledge is weak; Marketing, PR, Advertising, and in the past this would have scared me sh-----s. I've come to realise that being out of your comfort zone is fantastic, and I'm looking at that wide ranging remit as a challenge and an opportunity to grow.

### You should hire me because

I'm passionate, smart and creative. I can design and code, but do my best work in between. I'm empathetic and a good communicator, without being loud. I can think on my feet, and under pressure. I'm good in meetings. I can understand requirements and translate those to interactive products.

I'm modest and humble, but realise this isn't the time for modesty.
